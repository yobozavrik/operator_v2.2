# Claude Code Guidelines

## Debugging & Root Cause Analysis

- Do not fix symptoms before identifying the root cause.
- Fix at the source-of-truth (owner layer), not where the symptom appears.
- Avoid child-layer compensation (fallbacks, patches, duplicated logic, branching).
- Always do ultra-deep system research end-to-end before fixing:
  - top-down: route → page → container → orchestration → state
  - bottom-up: function → hook → service → API → DB
- Diagnose by layers:
  data/contracts → business logic → async/timing → UI state → integration → architecture
- If a bug appears in a child, inspect the parent/owner layer first.
- When changing a mechanic, align all directly coupled layers:
  contracts, handlers, queries, cache, serializers, loading/error states
- Be skeptical of one-file fixes; justify why other layers are unaffected.
- For frontend issues, inspect the full flow:
  route → layout → page → hooks → API → backend
- Prefer systemic fixes, but keep changes proportional.
- If re-architecture is required, define scope, risks, compatibility, and rollout order.
